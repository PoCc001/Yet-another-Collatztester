# Yet-another-Collatztester
This program tests, if the Collatz conjecture holds for all positive integers. To be able to compile and run this program you must use Visual Studio and a x64 processor, as it depends on compiler intrinsics to speed up the calculations.

Feel free to expand this small piece of software, as it is not very user-friendly and feature-rich. You could also make it multi-threaded and optimize it.
